# Scrimba - Solo Project Color Generator

This is a solution to the Color Generator solo project on Scrimba in the 'Working with APIs course'.(https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

This project is a solution to a challenge to create a dynamic and interactive color scheme generator using modern web technologies and integrating API services.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

    - Generate color schemes based on selected criteria or randomly.
    - Copy the hex code of any color to the clipboard with a simple click.
    - View dynamically rendered color blocks that represent the generated color scheme.

## My process

### Built with

    - Vanilla JavaScript: The core logic of the application, including the dynamic rendering of color blocks and the copy-to-clipboard feature, is written in plain JavaScript.
    - External API Integration: The application fetches color schemes from TheColorAPI, providing users with a variety of color options.
    - HTML5 and CSS3: Structured and styled using the latest HTML and CSS standards, ensuring a sleek and responsive design.
    - Font Awesome Icons: Used for visually pleasing UI elements.
    Google Fonts: Integrated for enhanced typography.

### What I learned

Developing the "Color Generator" was both challenging and rewarding. The main challenge was implementing the copy-to-clipboard functionality for the hex codes. It involved creating a temporary input element, copying the content, and then removing the element from the DOM. This was a great exercise in understanding DOM manipulation and JavaScript event handling.

Another key aspect I learned was working with external APIs. Fetching data from TheColorAPI and rendering it in a user-friendly format enhanced my skills in handling JSON data and asynchronous JavaScript.

This project also reinforced my understanding of dynamic HTML rendering. Creating color blocks and updating their styles based on fetched data was an excellent practice in manipulating the DOM based on data changes.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I plan to focus on improving the UI/UX of the application. This includes adding more interactive elements, refining the color block presentation, and possibly integrating more complex color algorithms. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring more advanced JavaScript and CSS techniques to enhance the application's performance and user experience.
